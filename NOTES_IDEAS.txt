ENGINE EDITOR NOTES:
- In 3D scene editor, press 'mouse right' for WASD movement
- Press shift and scroll mouse wheel to modify movement speed
- Press shift to 'run'

- The Voxel Extension does not have complicated generation logic, but it allows for easy insertion of such logic
- For example, cave density and height capping: The extension just does everything randomly, but users can control this.
- The base 2d noise map does not provide erosion algorithms, so I will need to create this. 
- The extension allows for insertion for custom noise maps.
- The extension allows for starting seeds, allowing for deterministic generation.

- Custom C++ Godot modules are more stable and more powerful than extensions, but less portable
- In order to use godot as a git submodule, but also have custom godot modules, godot has an option to declare custom modules
- Added a linux alias in order for quick builds:
alias gcomp="scons platform=linuxbsd use_llvm=yes use_static_cpp=no linker=mold custom_modules=../modules"


CURRENT PLAN:
- YOU DO NOT NEED FANCY EROSION ALGORITHMS!!! 
- MORROWIND'S BASE WAS DONE WITH A PROC GEN TERRAIN, BUT NO EROSION
- I need to create a biome layer (2d noise map)
- I need to create a erosion layer
- I need 1 layer for each random element: rivers, trees, lakes, towns, cliffs, e.t.c

- Create the base terrain with standard heightmap meshes, and then generate voxels only for overhanging terrain and caves
- Because the terrain is static, and caves/overhang should be mildly sparse, it should still be faster than pure voxels
- Hard part would be to figure out how to stitch the 2 meshes

NOISE RELATED:
- libnoise created a complex heightmap that relistically generated an earth-like terrain. 
- I need to port that into godot:
	https://libnoise.sourceforge.net/examples/complexplanet/index.html
- At least, I need to port enough as a starting point.

- libnoise is old however, so it would benefit to look at terrain algorithms mentioned in this video:

- Daggerfall is roughly 12,688,000 godot units

- I really do want runtime procedurally generated worlds. 
- You can implement the entire noise generation on GPU just fine.
- Objects like trees, rocks, rivers, e.t.c need to be calculated on CPU (gdscript)
- But, you could provide ONLY the vertices that will need to be accomodated




CURRENT PROBLEMS:
- Somewhere in the mesh generator, a vertice of an unaccounted value is being pushed into the mesh
-
