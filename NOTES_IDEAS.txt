- The Voxel Extension does not have complicated generation logic, but it allows for easy insertion of such logic
- For example, cave density and height capping: The extension just does everything randomly, but users can control this.
- The base 2d noise map does not provide erosion algorithms, so I will need to create this. 
- The extension allows for insertion for custom noise maps.
- The extension allows for starting seeds, allowing for deterministic generation.

CURRENT PLAN:
- YOU DO NOT NEED FANCY EROSION ALGORITHMS!!! 
- MORROWIND'S BASE WAS DONE WITH A PROC GEN TERRAIN, BUT NO EROSION
- I need to create a biome layer (2d noise map)
- I need to create a erosion layer
- I need 1 layer for each random element: rivers, trees, lakes, towns, cliffs, e.t.c

- Create the base terrain with standard heightmap meshes, and then generate voxels only for overhanging terrain and caves
- Because the terrain is static, and caves/overhang should be mildly sparse, it should still be faster than pure voxels
- Hard part would be to figure out how to stitch the 2 meshes
