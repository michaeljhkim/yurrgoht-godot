- The Voxel Extension does not have complicated generation logic, but it allows for easy insertion of such logic
- For example, cave density and height capping: The extension just does everything randomly, but users can control this.
- The base 2d noise map does not provide erosion algorithms, so I will need to create this. 
- The extension allows for insertion for custom noise maps.
- The extension allows for starting seeds, allowing for deterministic generation.

CURRENT PLAN:
- YOU DO NOT NEED FANCY EROSION ALGORITHMS!!! 
- MORROWIND'S BASE WAS DONE WITH A PROC GEN TERRAIN, BUT NO EROSION
- I need to create a biome layer (2d noise map)
- I need to create a erosion layer
- I need 1 layer for each random element: rivers, trees, lakes, towns, cliffs, e.t.c


GAME FEATURES NOTES:

- In order for the procedurally generated world to feel unrepetitive, motives and side quests need to be different.

- Each populated location (town, camps, cities, temples, e.t.c) will consider biases of as many as I can think of (probably with a template class):
	- racism
	- sexism
	- conflicts from previous history
	- zenaphobia
	- intelligence
	- strength
	- wealth
	- alliances
	- other traditions
	- lookism
	- politics
	- e.t.c

- Conflicts and wars between neighbouring locations may be influenced by:
	- The above parameters
	- A small misunderstanding that happened just once
	- Player influcence
	- e.t.c
- The point is to create as many very different kinds of village politics

- Conflicts will always be modified by player influence, for better or for worse:
	- Player joins a war between nations near the end, is sent to assassinate high ranking officials, and before anything else can be done, the final battle occurs
	- Maybe conflict resolves on its own
	- Maybe certain player actions causes the conflict to escalate
	- Players could perhaps create new allaiances in real time, maybe at the same time where the other side is planning on doing the same

- Towns can also do angry mobs, like lynchings.
- Terrorists/Cultists

- The game needs to present itself with a black and white view of good and evil, but as the game goes on, characters associated with good or evil will absolutely seem more grey
	- Absolute evil does not exist, only the will to propser.


- procedurally generated secrets need to feel actually good, must think of ideas
- look into nine-lives artstyle
